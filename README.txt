The goal of this app was to create shopping list app with css, html and javascript and understand the limitations/struggles of javascript in place of using frameworks like React. In addition, I am very forgetful of the items I need to buy and the price they should be so I thought that this would be a fun and useful project to create.

Current Features:
 - logs items and prices
 - displays saved items and prices
 - add items and prices
 - remove specific items and prices
 - clear all items and prices
 - saves items and prices in localStorage, so even if you end the session, your values will be saved (however, this is not as useful as it could be with offline-first)


Features that have not been implemented:
  - login authentication
  - offline-first (service workers)
  - not mobile-friendly (hover)
